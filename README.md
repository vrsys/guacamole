Guacamole is an extendable and efficient rendering system for visualizing 
different data types. It features a lightweight scene graph and a modern
deferred shading system. Many common post processing effects are already
integrated, e.g. screen space ambient occlusion, HDR, FXAA, volumetric light
effects, bloom and fog.

Installation
------------

You need a NVIDIA GPU that supports OpenGL 4.2 and CUDA.

### Windows

We recommend building guacamole with Visual Studio 2013. We created a zip file
with all necessary dependencies.
Get `externals_vc120RC.zip` from https://github.com/vrsys/guacamole-externals.
Create a new directory `externals/` under the project root.
Unpack `externals_vc120RC.zip` into the `externals/` directory.
Then configure with `cmake` and build the library with Visual Studio.

### Linux

You need schism, boost, CUDA, bullet, assimp, libjson, and cmake.

 * [schism](https://github.com/chrislu/schism)
 * [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

Configure with cmake and build with make.
